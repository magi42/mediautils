These are various utilities for reorganizing and converting photographs and video files.

_They were not written for public distribution and are rather hardcoded for personal use._

`file-videos-by-date`::
Finds videos from under the current directory recursively and files them by date.
Converts the file names to include timestamp.

`file-camera-videos`::
Finds videos from camera folder recursively and files them under the `camera` folder by date.
Converts the file names to include timestamp.

`file-recordings`::
Files audio files saved by Boldbeast recorder by date.
Converts to MP3 if necessary.
Cleans up caller names.
Renames to systematic names.

`images-to-pdf`::
Converts the given images to a PDF.
The base name of the first file is used for the PDF file.
The purpose of this program is to bind it as a file association in KDE to easily build PDFs in Doplhin.

`canon-half`::
Reduces the size of image files for web display.

`bin-files`::
Bins the given files to subdirectories containing 100 files each.

`whiteborders`::
Adds white borders to pictures for printing them, typically in 10x15 cm format.
Changes the image geometry slightly, because the borders must have equal width and height, but the output file must have the same geometry (2:3) as the input.
